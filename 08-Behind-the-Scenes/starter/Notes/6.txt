The THIS keyword

This keyword/variable is a special variable that is created for every execution context(every function). It takes the values of (points to) the 'owner' of the function in which the this keyword is used.

this is NOT static, it depends on how the dunction is called, and it's value is only assigned when function is actually called.

Functions
  - Method (this) = <Object that is calling the method>
  - Simple function call (this) = undefined
  - Arrow functions (this) = <this of surrounding function. (lexical this)>
  - Event listener (this) = <DOM element that the handler is attached to>
  (Also with new, call, apply, bind...)
This does NOT point to the function itself, and also NOT the its variable environment
