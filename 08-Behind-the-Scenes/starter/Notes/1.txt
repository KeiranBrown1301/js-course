What is JS?
High level
  - Every program needs recources! The dev doesn NOT have to worry, everything happens automatically.

Garbage Collection
  - Cleaning memory so we don;t have to!

Just in time Language
  - Abstraction over machine code. Convert machine code to english.

Multi Paradign
  - An approach or mindset to structuring code, which will direct coding style and technique
  - Procedural
  - OOP
  - Functional Programming
  - Imperative vs Declarative

Prototype based, Object oriented.
  - Arrays for example, inherit methods from prototypes.

First class functions
  - Functions are treated as variables. We can pass them to other functions and return them from functions.
  - Example, passing a function into another function.

Dynamic Language
  - No data type definitions. Types becomes knows at runtime.
  - Data type of variables is automatically changed.

Single Threaded
  - Concurrency model: How the JS engine handles multiple tasks.
  - JS runs one single thread, so just ONE THING AT A TIME.
  -

Non-blocking event loop
  - This is obtained by using an event loop. Takes long running tasks and runs them in the background.
