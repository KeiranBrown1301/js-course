What is a JS engine?
Its a program that executes JS code.
  - For example - The V8 Engine that works with google.

JS Engine?
  - Callstack - Execution content and where code is executed.
  - Heap - Object in memory and where objects are stored.

CS Sidenote - COmpilation vs Interpretation
  - COmpilation - Entire code is converted at once, and written into a binary file that canbe executed by a PC.

  - Interpretation - Interrpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line.

  - Modern JS uses Just in time (JiT). The entire code is converted into machine code at once and executed right away.

JIT COmpilation
  - Parsing -> Compilation -> Execution
  - All the while OPTIMIZATION is taking place

JS runtime
  - Runtime in the browser
    - Contained including all the things that we need to use JS. (In the browser, in this case.)
    - Engine + APIs (DOM, timers, fetch API, etc...)
    - Callback queue - onClick, timer, data, ... (Event loop)

  - Runtime in Node.js
    - engine
    - C++ bindings and thread pool
    - Callback queue
