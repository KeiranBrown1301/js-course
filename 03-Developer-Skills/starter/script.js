// Solving problems as a developer.

// Example - In an array of GPS coordinates, find the two closest points.
// Stay calm and slow down.
// Take a logical and rational approach.

// 4 steps.
// 1 - Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.
// 2 - Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub problems.
// 3 - Dont be afraid to do as much research as we have to. (Google, Stack overflow, MDN.)
// 4 - For bigger problems, write pusedo code before writing the actual code.
